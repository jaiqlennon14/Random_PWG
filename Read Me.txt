Homework Assignment 3

While not exactly designed as the template given, I've made countless efforts to make use of Javascript's prompt feature.. 
and with little progress. 
Instead, I decided to scrap that code and make use of two tutorials that advised the use of checkboxes.

I found the approach easier, and as able to make more sense of the logic whilst coding it.
There are some code in use that was found with personal reasearch, through the tutorials used, and even in the last day of instruction before the assignemnt's due date!

The UI was crafted with the use of Bootstrap. I made the decision because of it's built-in resizing feature, as well as the ease of implementation. 
It shoud also be noted that because Javascript is the main focus here, I wasn't pressed on the design of the UI, or even building it from scratch.

P.S.

I did try to add a feature to save the generated password, but to no avail... the project started to strench on for too long. I'd love to go back and finish it, though.
